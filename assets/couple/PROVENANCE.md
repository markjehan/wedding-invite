# The couple's photograph

`naveen-dulanjani.webp` was supplied by the user on 30 October 2026 for the link card WhatsApp draws
when a guest's invitation is sent.

`naveen-dulanjani-preview.jpg` is that photograph cropped square, 540 by 540 from x 30, y 40, so the
card shows the two of them and leaves the car's number plate out:

    ffmpeg -i naveen-dulanjani.webp -vf "crop=540:540:30:40" -q:v 3 naveen-dulanjani-preview.jpg

The invitation's gallery shows eight views of the same photograph (the seven below and the square card above), each centred on their faces
and keeping the cars' number plates out, until more photographs arrive:
